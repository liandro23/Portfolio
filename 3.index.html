<h3>About Ichigo Kurosaki</h3>
<p>High school student Kurosaki Ichigo is unlike any ordinary kid. Why? Because he can see ghosts. Ever since a young age, he's been able to see spirits from the afterlife. Ichigo's life completely changes one day when he and his two sisters are attacked by an evil, hungry and tormented spirit known as a Hollow. Right in the nick of time, Ichigo and his siblings are aided by a Shinigami (Death God) named Kuchiki Rukia, whose responsibility it is to send good spirits (Pluses) to the afterlife known as Soul Society, and to purify Hollows and send them up to Soul Society. But during the fight against the Hollow, Rukia is injured and must transfer her powers to Ichigo. With this newly acquired power, so begins Kurosaki Ichigo's training and duty as a Shinigami to maintain the balance between the world of the living and the world of the dead...</p>
<br>
<h3>Age</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Ichigo Kurosaki, the main protagonist of the manga and anime series "Bleach," is 17 years old at the end of the series.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Friends</h3>
<ul>
    <li>One of Ichigo Kurosaki's closest friends and rival. He also is Rukia Kuchiki's childhood friend. His zanpakuto is called Zabimaru and his bankai is called Hihio Zabimaru.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Expert Hand-to-Hand Combatant</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Physically, Ichigo's body is in top form. Ichigo has been trained in martial arts since he was a small child, both professionally and by his father. He has repeatedly shown great agility and coordination in his attacks. In addition to having powerful kicks and punches, Ichigo is proficient in counterattacks, takedowns, and body locks.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Master Swordsman</h3>
<ul>
    <li>In terms of fighting style while in his Shinigami form, Ichigo relies mainly on swordplay. Aside from his initial training with Urahara, he is essentially on a "learn as you go" training regimen; thusly, his skill has developed by fighting rather than formal instruction, becoming even more capable with every fight. His overall skill allows him to fight evenly against sword masters of Byakuya Kuchiki and Kenpachi Zaraki's caliber. While usually fighting right-handed, Ichigo appears to be ambidextrous, as he is proficient in wielding Zangetsu in his left hand.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Shunpo Expert</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Though not particularly versed in its various techniques, Ichigo is proficient enough in the technique itself to keep up with and even surprise high-level Shinigami with his speed. Byakuya Kuchiki, one of the most proficient users of Shunpo in Soul Society, complimented Ichigo's growing mastery of the technique. During his first demonstration of this skill, he knocked out three lieutenants and grabbed his Zanpakutō before any of them hit the ground.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Immense Reiatsu</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Ichigo has been noted on several occasions to have tremendously vast levels of spiritual energy, well beyond most other Shinigami. Even at less than half strength, his spiritual energy is comparable to a Captain-level fighter. Even when worn-out in battle, he can continue fighting effectively while still using Getsuga Tensho or unleashing and maintaining his Bankai. Because Ichigo's spiritual energy level is constantly very high, even at its base level without him consciously being aware of it, he rarely becomes exhausted in battle, meaning the sheer resilience and amount of energy Ichigo has is monstrous. Ichigo's spiritual energy is rather difficult for him to control, as he has no formal training in controlling it, and upon Hollowfication, his reiatsu fluctuates wildly. Due to this, and him having far more spiritual energy than his body can consciously contain, it leaks out constantly, preventing him from hiding it and effectively making stealth impossible when dealing with other spiritually-aware beings. He has learned how to harden his spiritual energy and enhance the strength of his attacks, or use it as a barrier to reduce the impact of attacks on him, if not negating them completely. He possesses some skill in channeling his spiritual power. His reiatsu is light-blue in color.
    </li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Enhanced Strength</h3>
<ul>
    <li>When he is in his Shinigami body, Ichigo's already impressive strength is greatly enhanced.  He can easily catch a number of blows, destroy thick and/or massive objects with ease, and a number of other physical feats not possible when he is in his Human body.
    </li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Immense Endurance</h3>
<ul>
    <li>When in his Shinigami form, Ichigo's endurance is strengthened to the point where he can continue fighting effectively after receiving many injuries, and can survive attacks which would easily kill normal Humans. Ichigo can withstand attacks which would be fatal to most Shinigami.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Enhanced Durability</h3>
<ul>
    <li> Ichigo becomes much more durable in his Shinigami form. He can withstand or outright shrug off a number of powerful attacks and keep fighting. Such is shown when he withstood an attack from Renji's shikai when he was trying to get to rukia.
