    <h3>Controversies</h3>
    <li>On January 5, 2023, Cenat was accused by TikToker Jovi Pena of downplaying and refusing to help her after her alleged rape at a New Year's Eve party he hosted. Pena said that at some point she asked Cenat if she could leave the party, to which he told her to go to sleep in an upstairs room due to her being drunk. Pena then said that a fellow party-goer named Djigui Seck entered said room and "brutally raped me to the point where I bled," while she was asleep. The next day, Cenat responded on stream, saying that the reason he did not respond earlier was because he went to contact the police and his lawyers. He also said he did not want to make the incident public. He said that Seck had been a good friend of his since high school, but that he had no knowledge of the alleged rape and that he had not been in contact with either party since the incident.</li>
