    <h3>About cape verde</h3>
    <p>The Cape Verde archipelago was uninhabited until the 15th century, when Portuguese explorers discovered and colonized
        the islands, thus establishing the first European settlement in the tropics. Because the Cape Verde islands were
        conveniently located to play a role in the Atlantic slave trade, Cape Verde became economically prosperous during
        the 16th and 17th centuries, attracting merchants, privateers, and pirates. It declined economically in the 19th
        century after the suppression of the Atlantic slave trade, and many of its inhabitants emigrated during that period.
        However, Cape Verde gradually recovered economically by becoming an important commercial center and useful stopover
        point along major shipping routes. Cape Verde became independent in 1975.</p>
