It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village. The story is told in two parts: the first is set in Naruto's pre-teen years (volumes 1–27), and the second in his teens (volumes 28–72). The series is based on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), which earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the following year, and Naruto (1997)
    Naruto was serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from September 1999 to November 2014, with its chapters collected in 72 tankōbon volumes.

A second series, which adapts material from Part II of the manga, is titled Naruto: Shippuden and ran on TV Tokyo for 500 episodes from February 2007 to March 2017. The English dub of Shippuden was broadcast on Disney XD in the United States from October 2009 to November 2011, airing the first 98 episodes before eventually switching over to Adult Swim's Toonami programming block in January 2014, starting over from the first episode. After Disney XD removed the series from broadcast, Viz Media began streaming new English dubbed episodes on their streaming service Neon Alley in from December 2012 to March 2016, starting at episode 99 and ending at episode 338 due to the service's shutdown.

    <h3>Naruto video games</h3>
    <li>Naruto video games have appeared for various consoles from Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft, based on Masashi Kishimoto's manga and anime.

The player pits their character against another character controlled by the game's AI or by another player, depending on the mode the player is in.

    <h3>Naruto son Boruto</h3>
    <li>Boruto[a] is a Japanese manga series written by Ukyō Kodachi and Masashi Kishimoto, and illustrated by Mikio Ikemoto. It initially began monthly serialization under the title Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,[b] with Kodachi as writer and Kishimoto as editorial supervisor in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump in May 2016, and was transferred to Shueisha's monthly magazine V Jump in July 2019. In November 2020, Kodachi stepped down, with Kishimoto taking over as writer. In April 2023, the series concluded the first part of the story and, following a brief hiatus, continued in August of the same year with a second part titled Boruto: Two Blue Vortex.[c] Boruto is a spin-off and a sequel to Kishimoto's Naruto and follows the exploits of Naruto Uzumaki's son, Boruto Uzumaki, and his ninja team.</li>
    <li>oruto originated from Shueisha's proposal to Kishimoto on making a sequel to Naruto. However, Kishimoto rejected this offer and proposed his former assistant Mikio Ikemoto to draw it; the writer of the film Boruto: Naruto the Movie, Ukyō Kodachi, created the plot. A 293-episode anime television series adaptation, produced by Pierrot, was broadcast on TV Tokyo from April 2017 to March 2023; a second part has been announced to be in development. Unlike the manga, which began as a retelling of the Boruto film, the anime begins as a prequel set before Boruto and his friends become ninjas in a later story arc. A series of light novels have also been written.</li>
    <li>The anime series has earned praise for its use of both new and returning characters, but the narrative of the manga was noted to be more serious as it focused more on the protagonist. Shueisha has shipped a million copies of the manga series by January 2017.</li>

    <h3>Naruto favorite saying</h3>
    <li>Naruto's official motto in life, "Believe it!" has been used countless times by Naruto, but this doesn't take away from its impact and importance. Sometimes in life, it's hard to find a goal you're passionate about, and it's even more difficult to commit to that goal and see it through.</li>
